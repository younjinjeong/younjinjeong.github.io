### Short description
This is a new version of ["System Complete" blog](https://kerberosj.tistory.com/).  

Based on my hobby of Remote Control, I work on various toy projects while studying and organizing related topics such as Robotics, Cloud, Distributed Computing, and Open Source. There may occasionally be some personal stories.

This blog was created with inspiration from the Pip-Boy computing interface in my favorite game, Fallout, and is currently running on GitHub Pages. It was built using Hugo, but since I have no design sense at all and know very little about frontend development, I relied heavily on Cursor IDE for assistance. I plan to continuously update it whenever I come up with new ideas.
