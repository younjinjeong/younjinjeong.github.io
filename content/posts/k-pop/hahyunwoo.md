### Discovering a Hidden Gem in K-pop: Ha Hyun-woo

While listening to my favorite Korean music today, I felt inspired to write a post about K-pop.

There are countless famous K-pop stars and artists out there, but I thought it would be nice to introduce some lesser-known yet incredibly talented singers.

Today’s featured artist is **Ha Hyun-woo**, the frontman of the Korean band **Guckkasten**. He is the band’s leader, vocalist, and guitarist.

One of his most iconic performances is the song **“Don’t Cry,”** which he sang on the show *King of Mask Singer*.

Check out the video below. It doesn’t have English subtitles, but I highly recommend giving it a listen—even if you don’t understand Korean. His emotion transcends language.

If you’d like to understand the lyrics, you can watch the version with English subtitles here:

If you’re a fan of K-dramas, you might recognize the song **“Diamond”** from *Itaewon Class*.  
Yes—that’s Ha Hyun-woo singing.

As you’ll hear, his voice is absolutely stunning. His falsetto, head voice, and chest voice blend seamlessly to create a phenomenal emotional impact—it resonates through your entire body.

Every time I listen to *Don't Cry*, I’m moved to tears. It’s such a powerful song.
