While listening to my favorite Korean music today, I decided to write a post about Korean pop. There are many famous K-pop stars and artists out there, but I thought it would be nice to introduce some lesser-known yet amazing singers.

Today’s featured singer is Ha Hyun-woo, the frontman of the Korean band Guckkasten. In the band, he serves as the leader, vocalist, and guitarist.
One of the greatest songs he performed is "Don’t Cry," which he sang on the show King of Mask Singer.
Check out the video below. It doesn’t have English subtitles, but I strongly recommend giving it a listen even if you don’t understand Korean.

If you’d like to understand the lyrics, you can watch the version with English subtitles here:

If you’re a big fan of K-dramas, you might have heard of Itaewon Class. Yes, Ha Hyun-woo is the singer of “Diamond.”

As you’ll hear, his voice is incredible. His falsetto, head voice, and chest voice all come together to create a phenomenal emotional impact—it resonates through your entire body. Whenever I listen to “Don’t Cry,” I’m moved to tears. What a powerful song!

기술 포스팅을 하나 할까 하다가 최근 다양한 원인으로 머리도 복잡하고 해서 음악을 틀었다. 나이가 좀 있다보니 아무래도 듣는 음악이 좀 오래된 것들이 많은데, 여자친구가 이런 취향을 참 싫어하더라. 어쨌든 뭐 나는 좋으니까 또 해외의 많은 다른 사람들도 좋아하지 않을까 해서 부담스럽게 길지 않은 포스팅을 끄적. 

Hugo로 만들고 있는 블로그도 조금씩 손보면서 뭔가 마음이 답답할때 이런 사이드퀘나 하나씩 해보면 좋겠다 싶어서.  
알잖아 모두? 처음엔, 그냥 걸었어.
