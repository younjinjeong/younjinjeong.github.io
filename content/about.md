## Short description
This is a new version of ["System Complete" blog](https://kerberosj.tistory.com/).  

Based on my hobby of Remote Control, I work on various toy projects while studying and organizing related topics such as Robotics, Cloud, Distributed Computing, and Open Source. There may occasionally be some personal stories.
