While I listen to my favorite Korean music today, I made up my mind to write a Korean pop post. Many famous k-pop stars and artists are out there, but I thought it would be good to introduce non-famous but great singers. 

Today, the singer is  HA Hyun Woo, who's a frontman of Guckkasten band in Korea. In the band, his role is a leader, vocal, and guitar. 

One of the greatest songs he sang, "Don't Cry" in the show "King of Mask Singer". 

The video link target is the song "Don't Cry." The video don't have English subtitle, but I strongly suggest you listen to his music even if you don't understand Korean.

If you are a big fan of K-drama, then you might hear about "Itaewon Class." And yes, Hyunwoo HA is the singer of "Diamond".

As you heard, his voice is crazy. His falsetto, head voice, chest voice, all quality of voice make fantastic emotions. While I listen to "Don't Cry," I always drop my tears. What a bad song! 

If you want to know more about him, then please check the links below.

기술 포스팅을 하나 할까 하다가 최근 다양한 원인으로 머리도 복잡하고 해서 음악을 틀었다. 나이가 좀 있다보니 아무래도 듣는 음악이 좀 오래된 것들이 많은데, 여자친구가 이런 취향을 참 싫어하더라. 어쨌든 뭐 나는 좋으니까 또 해외의 많은 다른 사람들도 좋아하지 않을까 해서 부담스럽게 길지 않은 포스팅을 끄적. 

Hugo로 만들고 있는 블로그도 조금씩 손보면서 뭔가 마음이 답답할때 이런 사이드퀘나 하나씩 해보면 좋겠다 싶어서.  
알잖아 모두? 처음엔, 그냥 걸었어.
