While listening to my favorite Korean music today, I decided to write a post about Korean pop. There are many famous K-pop stars and artists out there, but I thought it would be nice to introduce some lesser-known yet amazing singers.

Today's featured singer is Ha Hyun-woo, the frontman of the Korean band Guckkasten. In the band, he serves as the leader, vocalist, and guitarist.
One of the greatest songs he performed is "Don't Cry," which he sang on the show King of Mask Singer.
Check out the video below. It doesn't have English subtitles, but I strongly recommend giving it a listen even if you don't understand Korean.

If you'd like to understand the lyrics, you can watch the version with English subtitles here:

If you're a big fan of K-dramas, you might have heard of Itaewon Class. Yes, Ha Hyun-woo is the singer of "Diamond."

As you'll hear, his voice is incredible. His falsetto, head voice, and chest voice all come together to create a phenomenal emotional impactâ€”it resonates through your entire body. Whenever I listen to "Don't Cry," I'm moved to tears. What a powerful song!
